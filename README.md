# GMI-boundary
here I calculate the GMI bound of  mismatch decoder.  this boundary represent the lower bound of capacity that can be  reached with MisMatched Decoder.    I need to fix the equation of the boundry in the function:  'calc_GMI_rate'   in the book Information-Theoretic Foundations of Mismatched Decoding  page 24
